    sets are homogenous
    dictionaries: the key must all be of the same type
                  same for values
    tuples are the only hetergeneous type we have


- In context.declarations() -> the keys are ids and the values must be variables or fundecls
- Decide how we want to do set membership and rebinding!

- make a test to throw "throw new Error(`${this.iterable.id} has not been defined yet.`);
"
