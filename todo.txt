TODO:
constdecl => -- mutablebinding
varassign => -- immutablebinding

- add op for exponentiation (btw mult and prefix)
- Exp4 => Exp ?? as dictionary values?
- Types on dictionaries and matrices


- StringInterpolation (done but needs revision because of spaces)

- ForLoop(check and make sure this is correct)
- Function
- Parameter

First function file for safekeeping:
<function-unnamed-annotation.oil>

fun: int, int -> int
fun (x, y) =
    return x + y

________________________________________________________
So I had to add function calls to the ohm syntax.
I got them working, but not there is an issue with
these two lines (anonymous functions) in the functions
test file:
    (y) = 2 + y
    (x, y) = x + y

I can't figure out what is causing it to fail. Help plz
